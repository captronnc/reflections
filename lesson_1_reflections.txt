my reflections 3/6/16

some of the command line stuff is so difficult
I have a bsic understanding of how it works, but
there are so many errors.

***
How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file
help you see the bug that was introduced?

Being able to look at just the changes makes it easier
to spot problems.

***
How could having easy access to the entire history of a
file make you a more efficient programmer in the long
term?

It makes it easier to look back and see what worked and
what did not

***
What do you think are the pros and cons of manually
choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git,
vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
Docs does?

***
Why do you think some version control systems, like
Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while
others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

It is likely people using Git have more interconnections
between files than would normally be happening with
Google Docs

***
How can you use the commands git log and git diff to
view the history of files?

Simply, it can be used to look at dates and messages to
help narrow a search for a bug.

***
How might using version control make you more confident
to make changes that could break something?

Knowing that you can always go back to a working copy is
very beneficial.

***
Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you
want to try using Git for?

WHen I first began trying to use Git, it was difficult
and frustrating. Two weeks later, afterprogressing
through this course and some other stuff, it is really
beginning to take shape.

I am really excited about using Git now and want to use
it for everything I do.
